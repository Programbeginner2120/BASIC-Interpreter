# BASIC-Interpreter

This is a BASIC interpreter which I wrote in Java as part of my Principles of Programming Languages course (ICSI 311) at the University at Albany.

To run on your computer, either download the code or clone it into a git repository on your local machine. Make sure you have a compatible version of the Java Runtime Environment as well as Java itself to run the interpreter.

To run the interpreter, cd into the directory named interpreter and execute the following bash/zsh commands:

`javac Basic.java </br >
java basic [pass file with valid BASIC code here]`


The program will terminate automatically if the number of arguments does not equal 1, pertintent errors will occur if the file is invalid or the file does not contain valid BASIC code
